# Custom Printf
> The purpose of this project is to recreate a mock version of the unix printf function

Students of the sfcode , a software engineering school in San Francisco, California were placed with 
the task of recreating printf with certain restraints.

## Function

The prototype used is "_printf(const char *format, ...)" where format is a string that takes  unlimited number of inputs as values via variadic functions. Returns number of chars printed.

```shell
#include <stdio.h>

int printf(const char *format, ...);
int i = 0;
if (format[i] == %
{
  printf(format);
}
return(i)"
```

If the subscript of format matches %, it should print the word and return i.

## Developing

A brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
https://github.com/clturner/printf.git
```

%c char %s string %S string, replaces any chars that can't be produced.


```shell
./configure
make
make install
```
